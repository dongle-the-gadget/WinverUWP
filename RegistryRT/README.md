# RegistryRT

Access the registry from WinRT

## Acknowledgements

- Your app can't access the real registry, it can only access a fake registry built only for the application itself, as Microsoft notes for Project centennial applications (Notice this was reformulated to reflect many different people opinion and not just one person, change made because of complaints by https://twitter.com/Opus_010) --Fall 2017 by someone interested in Xbox and others
- It is impossible to publish an app to the Windows Store that can read the registry --Microsoft 2016
